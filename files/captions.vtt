00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.500
This is a library management system I made.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.700
This project is based on Django and Mysql.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.866
The front-end uses the Bootstrap framework

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.066
Navicat is used for database management.

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.733
This project implements the login function of two identities,

00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.966
reader identity and administrator identity.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.366
We first

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:17.900
log in

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.433
with the reader identity to this book management system

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.666
we entered Navicat

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.900
and copied a reader id

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.866
reader card,

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.300
then entered the password

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.666
and clicked reader login

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.900
to log in to this management system as a reader.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.466
This management system is mainly designed with two functions:

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.300
book query and borrowing books.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.133
We can Enter the book number,

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.466
book title, author, and publisher to search for books.

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.233
For example, if we search for Shanghai Translation Publishing House

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
and click Search,

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.166
we can query two books from

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.433
Shanghai Translation Publishing House.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
We copy the book number of the book Midnight Terror

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.266
and click to borrow or return the book

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.266
Enter the book number we just copied

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.600
and enter the borrowing period and estimated return period.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.133
Click on the borrowed book and the borrowing will be successful.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.733
We return to the main page of the borrowed book

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.800
and you can see that the book Midnight Terror has been

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.033
successfully borrowed.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.833
Click on the returned book

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.066
and the same operation

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.200
We can see that book just now

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000
has been returned.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.566
We use the administrator account to log in.

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.366
We can see that the administrator account

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.900
has two more functions.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.933
One is book storage

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.700
and the second is library card management.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.100
First, click on the book storage

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.833
input Book number,

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.000
category,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.833
book title,

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.433
publisher, author,

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:06.800
year, price,

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:11.066
quantity, click on the book to be stored and it will be successfully stored

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.700
When we query the book just now in the book query,

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:18.733
we can see

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:21.800
that Sadako's book has been successfully added to the library. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.666
Then click to borrow and return books.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.366
Because you are logged in with an administrator account,

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.366
So when borrowing and returning books,

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:31.633
We need to enter the library card number.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.266
Click to search

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.800
You can see all the books

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.066
 borrowed under this library card number.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:43.666
Click on library card management

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.400
We can delete the library card

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.033
or create a new one.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
Enter the card number,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.100
name, department, password and category

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:54.866
, then click Create

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:58.966
to create a new library card.
